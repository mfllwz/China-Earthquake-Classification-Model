# China-Earthquake-Classification-Model
Binary classification model for classifying earthquakes and explosions in China, and a ternary classification model that includes collapses. Both models can be used directly, and the model input reference is demo.npz. We recommend that you transfer it when applying it to small area classification to improve accuracy.
